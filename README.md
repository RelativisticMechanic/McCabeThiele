# The Problem
In distillation columns operated in refineries, we usually have a trayed tower through which separation takes place by the principle of equimolar counter diffusion. To improve the purity of the distillate, when we get the distillate from the top of the column, we send some back as condensed liquid.

The McCabe-Thiele method is a graphical method to calculate the number of stages required for a certain separation given reflux ratio and quality of the feed (i.e. how much of the feed is vapour and liquid).

This program shows how the number of stages required changes as you increase and decrease the RR.
